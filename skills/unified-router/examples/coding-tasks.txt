# Example Coding Tasks for Testing Unified Router

# Code Generation
create a Python function that sorts a list of integers
write a JavaScript function to validate email addresses
implement a REST API endpoint in Node.js

debug why the database connection is failing
troubleshoot this error message
resolve the issue with the login form
what's wrong with this loop
why isn't my function returning the expected value

# Code Review
review this codebase for quality issues
analyze this function for potential bugs
check my code for security vulnerabilities
audit the authentication module
review the API endpoints

# Refactoring
refactor this function to be more efficient
optimize this database query
clean up this messy code
restructure the project for better maintainability
improve the performance of this loop

# Framework-Specific
