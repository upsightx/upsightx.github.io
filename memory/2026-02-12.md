# Daily Memory - 2026-02-12

## Session Summary

### Completed All OpenClaw Improvement Tasks

**Phase 1: Basic Capability Enhancement** ✅
- Fixed idle detection script using `w` command
- Improved HEARTBEAT task execution logic
- Created project-analyzer skill for codebase analysis
- Git commit and push improvements

**Phase 2: Intelligent Upgrade** ✅
- Created priority-manager skill for automatic task priority judgment
- Created skill-coordinator skill for skill collaboration mechanism
- Created behavior-learner skill for user behavior analysis (active hours, command stats, recommendations)

**Phase 3: Multi-Model Optimization** ✅
- Created model-manager skill with 4 models configured
  - ark/glm-4.7 (free, 200K context)
  - openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7 (paid, 200K context)
  - openrouter/pony-alpha (paid, 128K context)
  - openrouter/auto (paid, 200K context)
- Implemented task routing for 5 task types (simple, coding, complex, chinese, long-context)
- Created cost monitoring and reporting

**Additional Skills Created** ✅
- knowledge-manager: Automatic knowledge organization (MEMORY.md and daily memory)
- smart-reminder: Proactive notifications based on user behavior patterns

### Git Commit Normalization

- Rewrote 14 commits to follow conventional commits format
- Unified all commit messages to English
- Created docs/COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md with commit message standards
- Force pushed to GitHub successfully

### Published Projects

1. **TaskWeaver** (https://github.com/upsightx/taskweaver)
   - Autonomous task execution framework

2. **Smart CLI Assistant** (https://github.com/upsightx/-cli-)
   - Smart CLI helper framework

3. **Code Analyzer AI** (https://github.com/upsightx/-ai-)
   - Code analysis AI engine

### Important Decisions

**Multi-Model Strategy Adjustment**
- User explicitly requested to pause multi-model routing optimization
- Reason: API costs too expensive
- Decision: Keep existing free model (ark/glm-4.7) for most tasks
- Note: Model-manager framework is in place but won't be actively used for cost reasons

**Commit Message Standards**
- All future commits must use conventional commits format
- Language: English only
- Format: `type: subject` (e.g., `feat: Add new feature`)
- Documented in docs/COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md
