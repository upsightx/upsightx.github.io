["Project Analyzer skill for codebase analysis\n- [x] Create smart-reminder skill for proactive notifications based on user behavior patterns\n- [x] Create knowledge-manager skill for automatic knowledge organization and updates\n\n### 3. Gemini \"Personal Intelligence\" Inspiration\n\n**Discovery**: Can proactively respond based on user data (photos, emails)\n\n**Application**: \n- Use memory system to analyze user behavior patterns\n- Predict user needs and proactively suggest features\n- Establish user preference learning mechanism\n\n**Implementation**:\n- [x] Analyze user active time periods (implemented by behavior-learner)\n- [x] Learn user common commands and task types (implemented by behavior-learner)\n- [x] Proactively recommend relevant features (implemented by behavior-learner)\n\n### 4. OpenRouter Multi-Model Strategy\n\n**Discovery**: Aurora Alpha (128k), Solar Pro 3 (free), Free Router (200k)\n\n**Application**: \n- Configure backup models for improved availability\n- Select optimal model based on task type\n- Cost optimization: use free models for simple tasks\n\n**Implementation**:\n```json\n{\n  \"models\": {\n    \"fallback\": [\"ark/glm-4.7\", \"openrouter/auto\"],\n    \"taskRouting\": {\n      \"simple\": \"solar-pro-3\",\n      \"complex\": \"openrouter/pony-alpha\",\n      \"coding\": \"openrouter/pony-alpha\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Immediate Improvements\n\n### Phase 1: Basic Capability Enhancement \u2705\n1. [x] Fix idle detection script\n2. [x] Improve HEARTBEAT task execution logic\n3. [x] Create project analyzer skill\n4. [x] Git commit and push improvements\n\n### Phase 2: Intelligent Upgrade\n1. [x] Implement automatic task priority judgment\n2. [x] Establish skill coordination mechanism\n3. [x] Add user behavior learning\n\n### Phase 3: Multi-Model Optimization \u2705\n1. [x] Configure backup models\n2. [x] Implement task routing strategy\n3. [x] Monitor model usage costs\n\n## Improvement Log\n\n### 2026-02-11\n- Fixed idle detection script, using `w` command to detect terminal idle\n- Created this improvement plan document\n- Next step: implement remaining Phase 1 tasks\n\n### 2026-02-12\n- Created TaskWeaver open-source project and pushed to GitHub\n- Created TopicPicker intelligent topic selection module\n- Automatically created 2 GitHub repositories (smart CLI assistant, code analysis AI engine)\n- Implemented automatic task priority judgment (priority-manager skill)\n- Established skill coordination mechanism (skill-coordinator skill)\n- Created user behavior learner (behavior-learner skill)\n- Created multi-model manager (model-manager skill)\n  - Configured backup model chain (4 models)\n  - Implemented task routing strategy (5 task types)\n  - Provided cost monitoring and reporting\n- Created knowledge-manager skill for automatic knowledge organization\n- Created smart-reminder skill for proactive notifications\n- Normalized git commit messages and created COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md\n- Phase 2 complete \u2705\n- Phase 3 complete \u2705\n- All improvements pushed to GitHub\n- All planned tasks complete! \ud83c\udf89"]
